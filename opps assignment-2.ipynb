    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) that allows us to represent the essential features of an object or entity while hiding the unnecessary details. It focuses on defining the structure and behavior of an object in a simplified and generalized manner so that the complexities are hidden from the user."

    "Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex real-world entities into their essential characteristics, focusing on the relevant features while hiding unnecessary details. It allows programmers to create a model of an object or system with only the necessary attributes and behaviors to represent its functionality, without exposing the internal workings.\n",

    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (behaviors) that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class. It allows data to be accessed and modified only through the defined methods, providing data hiding and protecting the internal state of the object from unauthorized access."
